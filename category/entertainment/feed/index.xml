										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Shah Rukh Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali collaborated on the blockbuster film &#8220;Devdas&#8221; 22 years ago. According to the latest reports, the duo is likely to reunite for another film soon. Bhansali initially announced his film &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Salman Khan and Alia Bhatt in 2019; however, the film which was slated for a theatrical release in 2020, did not commence shooting. The latest news regarding the film is that Bhansali has put a hold on his dream project &#8220;Baiju Bawra&#8221;, starring Ranveer Singh, as he is now keen on directing &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; with Shah Rukh Khan, according to a report on India.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘Jawan’, ‘Pathaan’ to compete with Hollywood action films for Vulture’s Stunt Awards</strong><br />
Several Indian media outlets have reported that the &#8220;Dunki&#8221; actor and Bhansali have already had multiple meetings regarding this film. The light-hearted romantic comedy is expected to be made soon. Reports also suggest that the lead female role might be played by Deepika Padukone instead of Alia Bhatt. The storyline of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; centres on a couple spanning different generations who develop feelings for each other. A man in his forties experiences love for a woman younger than him, prompted by his bedridden father&#8217;s condition. The father decides to transfer his wealth to his son, but with the condition that the son must fall in love and improve his lifestyle as per the father&#8217;s wish. Reports also hint that the production has already begun, and fans might receive the announcement of &#8220;Inshallah&#8221; very soon.</p>
